<h3 style = float: center;> Hi! My name is Rose Nowak. I am currently a freshmen in Computer Science at the University of Illnois
at Urbana Champaign. I am from Chicago and I also spend most of my summers with my family in Poland. I love Computer Science and
I'm always looking for new things to make or mess around with. Last summer I spent three amazing weeks at Google in Chicago. 
There I learned so much about the value of teamwork as well as three different programming languages. In high school, I was very
involved in the Computer Science Department and took CS classes for 4 years before coming to college. Currently I am taking 
CS 125 and I'm excited to take more classes next semester.</h3>
